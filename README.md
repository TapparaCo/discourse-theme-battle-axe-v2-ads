# Ads for Tappara.co Discourse theme Battle Axe

Copyright (c) 2019 Tappara.co. Released under the MIT license.

In this repository we host the UpClouds ads for the theme [Battle Axe](https://github.com/TapparaCo/discourse-theme-battle-axe-v2-home) as a separate component.

This theme contains the branding of our hosting partner https://upcloud.com. For them we have implemented locally served ads to the header and footer areas. These will not be blocked by generic adblockers, thus providing new commercial opportunities for fellow Discourse admins.

These code snippets include UpCloud.com logo art and Google Analytics click tracking, so **modification is needed** for your own project.

If you find this customization useful, a link back to https://tappara.co is appreciated.
